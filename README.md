# PoiRACG


This repository contains the code for the paper "Covert Knowledge Poisoning Attacks in Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation".

## Key Innovations
### üõ°Ô∏è Dual-Phase Stealth Mechanism
1. **Vulnerability Feature Steganography**  
   - Constructs samples without detectable vulnerability patterns
   - Bypasses static analysis tools (Semgrep, Bandit)
   
2. **Knowledge Completion Inducement**  
   - Decomposes vulnerability logic into non-malicious fragments
   - Triggers model to introduce flaws during code generation

## Dataset & Evaluation
In this work, we use CoNaLa in for attack testing. The data for the experiment can be found in the dataset folder. These datasets can also be downloaded directly from huggingface.

## Project Structure
```
PoiRACG 
|-- get_poisoncode.py # implement the indution code generation
|-- run.py # implement the attack against RACG
|-- evaluate_cases.py # implement attack result evaluation 
```

## Execution Workflow
### Stage 1: Induction Code Generation
```
python get_poisoncode.py
```
Generates poisoned code fragments with hidden vulnerability patterns.

### Stage 2: RACG Attack Execution
```
python run.py
```
Runs the poisoning attack against Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation systems.

### Stage 3: Performance Evaluation
```
python evaluate_cases.py
```
executes the command to evaluate the performance results.
